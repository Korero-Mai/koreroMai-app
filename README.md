#The simplest boilerplate

This is my attempt for a barebone React/Redux/React-router setup. When I mean barebone, I mean "barely functional". Add whatever you want to it!

#What's in it

- A minimal React setup
- A minimal Redux setup, with a minimal combinedReducers() setup
- A minimal react-router setup
- A minimal Express server
- A minimal database setup using knex
- A minimal API endpoints setup
- A test folder with example tests for client, database and reducers. Switches between tape and ava, choose the one you like best

And that's pretty much all.

#Ideas to make it better? Glaring mistakes? Let's make it better!

But let's keep it small.
